* This exercise covers the exploitation of a code execution in Ruby-on-Rails using XML and YAML.


## Introduction

* This course details the exploitation of the vulnerability `CVE-2013-0156`. 

* This vulnerability is caused by an arbitrary deserialization that can be used to trigger `SQL injection` and even `Code execution`. 

* In this exercise, we are going to focus on the code execution.

## Exploitation

* Multiple public exploits are available for this vulnerability. For example, the one located [here](https://gist.github.com/postmodern/4499206) can be used.

* This exploit will generate a payload similar to the following request's body:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<exploit type="yaml">--- !ruby/hash:ActionController::Routing::RouteSet::NamedRouteCollection
? |
  foo
  (RUBY; @executed = true) unless @executed
  __END__
: !ruby/struct
  defaults:
    :action: create
    :controller: foos
  required_parts: []
  requirements:
    :action: create
    :controller: foos
  segment_keys:
    - :format</exploit>
```
* Where `RUBY` is some arbitrary Ruby code.

* The idea here is to create a new action with arbitrary code in it. By default, Rails doesn't support pure `yaml` in a request body. But it supports `XML` that can embeds `YAML` in it (this explains the first two lines of the payload). 

* Finally, the `@executed` is used to ensure that the code is only run once.

* We recommend you use the exploit above as copying and pasting the payload will break the syntax of the `YAML`. 

* `YAML` is very sensitive to line-break and whitespaces. Here we can see that the YAML is used to run some Ruby code.

* In our example, the application only contains one route that uses the `GET` method. However, the request needs to contain a body for the payload. 

* To bypass this limitation, the header `X-HTTP-Method-Override` can be used. The exploit linked will do this automatically. You just need to find the right Ruby code to gain code execution.

## Conclusion

* This exercise showed you how to exploit `CVE-2013-0156` to gain code execution on a server by adapting an exploit to your need.
